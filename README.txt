# WebApp2
A simple web application that allows users to search for and add acronyms that are used at Rockwell Automation.

# Background
Every year, Rockwell Automation hosts the Innovation Challenge, a three month event where employees develop an idea that can improve Rockwell Automation.
My team's idea was to create a web application that keeps track of the (thousands) of acronyms that employees use within Rockwell.
My role was to develop the prototype of this application, which allowed me to gain experience using HTML, Javascript, PHP, Apache, Flask web framwork, 
Bootstrap web framework, Express web framework, AngularJS, Node.js, and MySQL databases.
