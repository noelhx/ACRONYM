# ACRONYM
A simple web application that allows users to search for acronyms that are commonly used at Rockwell Automation.

# Background
Every year, Rockwell Automation hosts the Innovation Challenge, a three month event where employees develop an idea that can improve Rockwell Automation.
My team's idea was to create a web application that keeps track of the (thousands of) acronyms that employees use within Rockwell, and my role was to develop the application prototype.
